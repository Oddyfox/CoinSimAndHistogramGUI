# CoinSimAndHistogramGUI
Simple coin flip simulator with histogram visualization GUI.

For each simulation, the designated number of 'coins' are flipped and a HEADS is counted as a success.
Then, all of the unique simulations are plotted on a histogram with their respective number of successes.

As you increase the number of coins, and more importantly the number of simulations, a pattern should emerge.
This is an illustration of the Central Limit Theorem. For sufficient values of Coins and Simulations, a consistant peak and bell curve should be centered at half the value of the coins flipped per simulation. This is because we should expect, with a fair coin, that HEADS has a 50% probability.
